Feature:
  As a brewer
  I want to use calculators
  So that I can work on beer recipes

#Scenario: Calculator homepage
#  Given I am on the page "tools"
#  When I select "Force Carbonation Calculator" from "jumpMenu"
#  Then I should be on the page "tools"
#  And I should see "Saturation by Style"
