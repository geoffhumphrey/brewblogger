### BrewBlogger 2.3.2 ###

Finally! The latest version of BrewBlogger has been released. This version fixes several bugs and incorporates a few new features, including:
  * The ability to enter up to 15 grains and 15 hops into recipes and logs - that's 6 more than previous for each.
  * An enhanced hop bitterness calculator where users can input up to 20 hop additions. The cacluations now take into account whether pellets or whole hops are being used.
  * A completely reworked printing feature that outputs cleaner, more user-friendly pages.
  * One new theme based upon the BrewBlogger.net theme and inspired by the color scheme from a bottle of St. Bernardus Abt 12.

 Note: version 2.3.2 will be the final BrewBlogger release utilizing the current code structure. A conversion is planned for release in 2011.

# What is... #
BrewBlogger is a easy to set up, easy to use, browser-based homebrewing log. It is a PHP/MySQL-based system that provides today's home-based or small beer/mead brewer not only a fast and easy way to record their brewing activities, but also forum to share their zymurgistic efforts and expertise with the homebrewing community around the world.

BrewBlogger was developed by brewing and computer geek Geoff Humphrey for [zkdigital.com](http://www.zkdigital.com) - mainly at his own whim and evolving need.
